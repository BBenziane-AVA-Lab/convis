Quickstart:

 - I'm an experimentalist and I want to fit models to my data
 - I need some spikes that look like they came from the retina/LGN/V1/...
 - I



Fitting Data
------------

First, you need to get your data in a certain format:
 - videos or stimuli can be `time` by `x` by `y` numpy arrays, or `1` by `channel` by `time` by `x` by `y`.
 - all sequences have to have the same sampling frequency (bin-length)
 - if you want to fit a spike train and you only have the spike times, you need to convert them into a time sequence


.. code-block::
    python

    inp = np.zeros((10000,100,100))
    out = np.zeros(10000)

Then, you need to choose a model.
